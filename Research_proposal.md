<p>Selenium is an essential micronutrient with important functions in human health and several pathophysiological conditions. The biological effects of selenium are largely mediated by selenium-containing proteins (selenoproteins). Selenoproteins represent diverse molecular pathways and biological  functions [1]. There are 25 genes encoding selenoproteins in humans [1]. In selenoproteins, the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec, U) is inserted in the nascent polypeptide chain during the process of translational recoding of the UGA stop codon [2]. In addition to the UGA-codon, a cis-acting element in the mRNA, called Sec-insertion sequence (SECIS), binds SBP2 to recruit other proteins, such as eukaryotic elongation factor selenocysteine-tRNA specific, to form the complex responsible for the recoding process [3]. Those peptides or proteins or enzymes containing selenocysteine are called selenopeptides or selenoproteins or selenoenzymes respectively. These selenoproteins play a critical role in antioxidant defense, hormone metabolism, immune responses and muscle development. [1] There are selenoproteins that have incorporated Sec under a precise process requiring the UGA codon, a specified tRNA (Sec tRNA [Ser]Sec), some regulatory proteins, and the SECIS element. Second, there are proteins that contain selenomethionine (SeMet), in addition to Sec. The third class consists of selenium-binding  proteins (SBP), which bind Se by some unknown mechanisms [4]. All these selenoproteins are broadly divided into three families such as Glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), Thioredoxin reductases (TRs) and Iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs). Being an important component of various antioxidant selenoprotein enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR), plays an important role in combating oxidative stress caused due to excessive generation of ROS (reactive oxygen species). We will be focusing on two protein families Glutathione Peroxidases and Thioredoxin Reductases which have isoforms with selenocysteine and cysteine at the active sites. The presence of selenium improves the redox properties of the protein.</p>

<p>Fig.1 Chemical structure of selenocysteine and cysteine. The two compounds differ by one atom, a selenium atom in selenocysteine and a sulfur atom in cysteine.</p>
<p>These two proteins take place in redox reactions. Glutathione  peroxidase  (GPx) oxidizes thiols to disulfides with an active site that contains a Sec and thioredoxin reductases (TrxR)  feature  a  selenosulfide  bond  (GCUG motif) in the active site that reduces disulfides to thiols.[5]</p>
<ul>
<li>Glutathione Peroxidase</li>
</ul>
<p>Glutathione acts as an antioxidant, a free radical scavenger and a detoxifying agent. It also  acts as a coenzyme for enzymes and it protects against oxygen radicals and toxic compounds. Se- dependent GSH peroxidase is capable of utilizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and a variety of organic hydroperoxides as substrates. Glutaredoxins belong to the thioredoxin superfamily of structurally similar thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases catalyzing thiol-disulfide exchange reactions via reversible oxidation of two active-site cysteine residue. The GPX and TRXR gene is conserved in human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, dog, cow, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and frog. This family includes various isoforms in humans such as GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, GPX5, GPX6, GPX7, GPX8. Of which GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4 and GPX6 have a sec residue in its active site and GPX5, GPX7 and GPX8 have a cys residue in place of it. The biological functions include cellular response to oxidative stress, spermatogenesis and reduced phospholipid hydroperoxide. The protein belongs to the alpha-beta class. The catalytic site of GSHPx contains a conserved residue which is either a cysteine or, in many eukaryotic GSHPx, a selenocysteine [6].</p>

<li>Reaction Mechanism Followed By Glutathione Peroxidase Isoforms</li>
</ul>
<p>Gpx1, Gpx2, GPx3, Gpx5, Gpx6, Gpx7, Gpx8 follow a reaction as below</p>
<p>2 glutathione + H2O2 = glutathione disulfide + 2H2O</p>
<p>Step 1 - RSeH + H2O2 → RSeOH + H2O</p>
<p>Step 2 - RSeOH + GSH → GS-SeR + H2O</p>
<p>Step 3 - GS-SeR + GSH → GS-SG + RSeH</p>
<p>Step 4 - Glutathione reductase then reduces the oxidized glutathione to complete the cycle :</p>
<p>glutathione disulfide + NADPH + H+ → 2GSH + NADP+.</p>
<p>GSH represents reduced monomeric glutathione. The mechanism involves oxidation of the selenol of a selenocysteine residue by hydrogen peroxide. This process gives the derivative with a selenenic acid (RSeOH) group. The selenenic acid is then converted back to the selenol by a two step process that begins with reaction with GSH to form the GS-SeR (selenenyl sulfide) and water. A second GSH molecule reduces the GS-SeR intermediate back to the selenol, releasing GS-SG as the by-product.</p>
<ul>
<li>GPX4 catalyzes the following reaction:</li>
</ul>
<p>2 glutathione + lipid–hydroperoxide → glutathione disulfide + lipid–alcohol + H2O</p>
<p>This reaction occurs at the selenocysteine within the catalytic center of GPX4. During the catalytic cycle of GPX4, the active selenol (-SeH) is oxidized by peroxides to selenenic acid (-SeOH), which is then reduced with glutathione (GSH) to an intermediate selenodisulfide (-Se-SG). GPX4 is eventually reactivated by a second glutathione molecule, releasing glutathione disulfide (GS-SG).</p>
<p>Ferroptosis is a recently recognized type of programmed cell death and plays an important role in cancer biology and therapies.</p>

<p>Fig.2 A. Lipid peroxidation pathways. ACSL4 (acyl-CoA  syntheta-se  long-chain  family  member  4) catalyzes the ligation of long-chain PUFAs (phos-pholipids  (PLs)  containing  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  (PUFAs) with CoA, and LPCAT3 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3) promotes the esterification and incorporation of these products into membrane phospholipids (PL). [8] PUFA-containing PL is oxidized by iron-dependent enzymes LOX (lipoxygenases) or POR (cytochrome  P450  oxidoreductase), resulting in lipid peroxidation, membrane damage and subsequent ferroptosis. [8] B. Antioxidant pathways. Cysteine is imported into the cell by(two members of the solute carrier family 7 member 11) SLC7A11/SLC3A2 complex for the synthesis of GSH. [8] GPX4 uses GSH as a substrate and reduces the membrane phospholipid hydroperoxide to harmless lipid alcohols, thereby preventing the accumulation of lethal lipid ROS and suppressing ferroptosis. Alternatively, cells utilize the FSP1 (ferroptosis suppres-sor protein 1) axis to suppress lipid peroxidation and prevent ferroptosis. [8]</p>
<ul>
<li>Thioredoxin Reductase</li>
</ul>
<p>Mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) are homodimers, homologous to glutathione reductase and have a selenocysteine residue in the conserved C-terminal sequence -Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly. It is involved in the regulation of cellular redox reactions, growth and differentiation. It contains a selenocysteine residue at the C-terminal active site that is essential for catalysis. [8] Also has reductase activity on hydrogen peroxide. [8] Superfamily of Thioredoxin Reductase represents the C-terminal domain in FAD- and NAD-linked reductases, FAD is a prosthetic group and catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction, reduces disulfide protein thioredoxin (Trx) to its dithiol - containing form. The selenoprotein showed two isoelectric points at pH 5.2 and pH 5.3 [8]. TRXR activates the p53 tumor suppressor, manifests other tumor suppressor activities, and is specifically targeted by carcinogenic electrophilic compounds. p53 being a tumor suppressor, suggests that TRXR plays a major role in cancer prevention. Examination of a number of human and mouse cancer cell lines showed that they had elevated levels of thioredoxin reductase, but not other selenoproteins, and knockdown of TRXR in these cells disrupted characteristics of malignancy as well. [9] On the other hand, TRXR has a role in promoting cancer as well. Its over-expression in many cancer cell lines has made its exposure to many anti-cancer drugs and potent inhibitors that alter cancer-related properties of malignant cells. [9] This dual nature of the protein has made it an interesting target for further studies. However, the cancer promoting or cancer preventing properties of TRXR1 have greater influence on the fate of a cell may be difficult to predict. It possibly seems that lack of knowledge in many areas of selenium function has made it essential for additional genetic, mechanistic and animal studies before undertaking large, very expensive human trials. [9]</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanism Followed By Thioredoxin Reductase Isoforms</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed mechanism of mammalian TrxR has not been known. The mammalian Se-containing TrxR reduces lipid hydroper-oxides  and  H2O2 and  this  activity  is lost in the Cys mutant enzyme. The catalytic intermediates consist of a selenol,  a  putative  selenenic  acid,  and  the sulfenyl sulfide enzyme forms. [10] The initial reaction is that theselenenylsulfide receives electrons from NADPH via the FADand  redox-active  dithiol  of  the  first  subunit  to  produce  a  sulf-hydryl and a selenol (-SeH) in the second subunit. Because of the low pKavalue of the selenol, selenolate should be a predominant form  under  physiologic  conditions. [10] Because  it  is  a  strong  nu-cleophilic, selenolate is more susceptible to oxidation by H2O2 than thiols, yielding selenenic acid (-SeOH). [10] One cysteine thiol (most  likely  Cys497)  reacts  with  the  selenenic  acid  to  produce water and to reform the sulfenyl sulfide. A second thiol (most likely Cys59 From the other subunit) would attack the bridge to regenerate the selenol. Therefore, the sulfenyl sulfide serves as either  a  catalytically  essential  redox  center  or  transient  intermediate  during  peroxide  reduction. [10]</p>

<p>Fig.4 Postulated mechanism for Trx reduction by mammalian TrxR.</p>
<p>The catalytic reaction starts by reduction of the sulfenyl sulfide to the selenolate anion as for H2O2 reduction.  The  selenolate  anion  (-Se-)  attacks  the  disulfide  of  Trx. The  resulting  enzyme–Trx-mixed  sulfenyl sulfide  (C) is attacked by Cys497 to regenerate the sulfenyl sulfide, which will be  reduced  by  the  active-site  thiolate  from  the  other  subunitagain  (D).  During  the  reaction,  the  active-site  dithiol maintains  the  selenol  in  the  reduced  state. [10]</p>

<p>Table. 2 Structural information of glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase</p>
<p>Glutathione peroxidase was discovered in 1957 by Gordon C. Mills. (GPX) (EC 1.11.1.9) is the general name of an enzyme family with peroxidase activity whose main biological role is to protect the organism from oxidative damage.[12] The class of this enzyme is Oxidoreductases. The biochemical function of glutathione peroxidase is to reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and to reduce free hydrogen peroxide to water. [11]
Several isozymes are encoded by different genes, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) is the most abundant version, found in the cytoplasm of nearly all mammalian tissues, whose preferred substrate is hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides; it is expressed in nearly every mammalian cell, though at much lower levels. Glutathione peroxidase 2 is an intestinal and extracellular enzyme, while glutathione peroxidase 3 is extracellular, especially abundant in plasma.[13] Eight different isoforms of glutathione peroxidase (GPx1-8) have been identified in humans. Mammalian GPx1, GPx2, GPx3, and GPx4 have shown to be selenium-containing enzymes, whereas GPx6 is a selenoprotein in humans with cysteine-containing homologues in rodents. GPx1, GPx2, and GPx3 are homotetrameric proteins, whereas GPx4 has a monomeric structure, its antioxidative protective system depends heavily on the presence of selenium. The catalytic triad consisting of C462, Q81, and W136 is localized at a flat impression of the protein surface in GPX4.[14] GPx4 is unique among GPx-isoforms. The lack of structural elements in GPX4 when compared to other isoforms of GPX, may allow the efficient binding of complex lipid molecules at the active site. [14]
It has been shown that low levels of glutathione peroxidase as measured in the serum may be a contributing factor to vitiligo. [14] In one study, the activity of glutathione peroxidase along with other antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase was not associated with coronary heart disease risk in women. [15] Glutathione peroxidase activity was found to be much lower in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.[16] One study has suggested that glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase polymorphisms play a role in the development of celiac disease. [17]
The protein encoded by this GPX1 gene forms a homotetramer structure. As with other glutathione peroxidases, GPx1 has a conserved catalytic tetrad composed of Sec or Cys, Gln, Trp, and Asn, where the Sec is surrounded by four arginines (R 57, 103, 184, 185; bovine numbering) and a lysine of an adjacent subunit (K 91'). These 5 residues bind glutathione (GSH) and are only present in GPx1. [18] Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene.[19] Glutathione peroxidase 1 is characterized in a polyalanine sequence polymorphism in the N-terminal region, which includes three alleles with five, six or seven alanine (Ala) repeats in this sequence. The GPx1 allele with five Ala repeats is significantly associated with breast cancer risk. [19] GPX4 shares the amino acid motif of selenocysteine, glutamine, and tryptophan (catalytic triad) with other glutathione peroxidases.</p>

<p>GPx5, GPx7 and GPx8 are cysteines (C) instead of selenocysteine (U) present in the catalytic triad. GPx7 and GPx8 have no GSH binding domain. They also differ with the Cys block. GPx7 and GPx8 have ER retrieval motifs for transportation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. [21] GPx7 and GPx8 are distinctly different from the real glutathione peroxidases of mammals, the SecGPxs, as the Sec residue is replaced by a Cys. GPx8 also carries a replacement in the catalytic tetrad, by which Gln is substituted for Ser. [20] Theoretically such a replacement is not expected to have a major impact on catalysis, because either the Gln nitrogen or the Ser oxygen could function as a proton acceptor in the active site for the interaction with  hydroperoxide. [20] GPx7 is a luminal protein and GPx8 is a transmembrane protein. Both the GPx7 and the GPx8 sequences include an N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved off in the mature protein with an ER retention sequence at the C-terminus. Since, both enzymes are ER-resident proteins with different topologies. [20]</p>
<p>Thioredoxins are small disulfide-containing redox proteins that have been found in living organisms. Thioredoxin serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. It interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism based on reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol. [21], [22] The thioredoxins are maintained in their reduced state by the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase, in a NADPH-dependent reaction [23]
Thioredoxin is a 12-kD oxidoreductase protein. Thioredoxin proteins also have a characteristic tertiary structure termed the thioredoxin fold (The thioredoxin fold is a protein fold common to enzymes that catalyze disulfide bond formation and isomerization.) [24] The active site contains dithiols in a CXXC motif. These two cysteines are the key to the ability of thioredoxin to reduce other proteins. [25] For Trx1, this process begins by attack of Cys32. [25] Almost immediately after this event Cys35, the other conserved Cys residue in Trx1, forms a disulfide bond with Cys32, thereby transferring 2 electrons to the substrate which is now in its reduced form. Oxidized Trx1 is then reduced by thioredoxin reductase, which in turn is reduced by NADPH as described above. [25]</p>

<p>Fig. 7 K29 would interact with the carboxyl group of the C terminus and R351 with Q494. Sulfur atoms of C497 and C498 still point into the inner side of the enzyme. In such a conformation electron transport to the substrate Trx would not be possible. The TrxR wild-type possessing U498 Instead of C498, would have a negative charge at physiological pH due to the lower pKaof the selenol compared to a thiol. The structure implies that this negative charge inside the TrxR molecule is stabi-lized by K29. [26] The side-chain ofE122 is close to the carboxyl end of the C terminus. The C497 and C498 sulfur atoms are solvent-exposed and therefore able to interact with substrates. The included tryptophan (W31) can interact with W114 in a similar way as W114 interacts with W114 of another dimer in the TrxR structure. The swapping W114 side-chain might represent a signal for Trx binding and then S111 could already be in a favorable position to facilitate deprotonation ofC497 during catalysis. For this reason, it is plausible that W114 might be involved in Trx binding. Residues W114, S111 and R117 are conserved in rat TrxR1 and mouse TrxR2, suggesting a similar Trx binding in these enzymes. [26]</p>

<p>Most HCC cell lines have a minimal  SBP1  expression,  with  the  exception  of SMMC7721. SBP1 only exhibited its impact on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis following treatment with hydrogen peroxide;these results indicated that SBP1 might exert its tumor suppressive power through modulation of the tumor redox microenvironment. According to [27] SBP1 could greatly inhibit the activity, but not expression of GPX1 in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The poor responses of patients with HCC to chemotherapy might be due to low SBP1 expression and high GPX1 activity, thus increasing SBP1 expression and decreasing GPX1 activity could be a novel strategy for cancer treatment. [27] GPx7 interacts with numerous proteins including   ADF,   GRP75,   HSP7C,   ERp72,   eEF1A-1,   U-Tmod,  ErJ3,  and  Histone  H1b,  in  addition  to  the  GRP78,  PDI,  and  XRN2  [28]. The biological significance of these interactions  between  GPx7  and  binding  proteins  remains  to  be  explored.  For  example,  the  ADF  protein,  which  regulates  cargo  transportation  together with Cofilin in the trans-Golgi network [28],  U-Tmod  (TMOD3),  which  binds  to  actin  monomer to determine cell polarity [28], could be regulated by GPx7 via thiol-disulfide shuttling.  On  the  other  hand,  GPx7  may  cooperate  with GRP75, which contains mitochondrial targeting  sequences  [28]  and  binds  to  transcription factors such as  p53  [28], to shuttle  mitochondrial  proteins  into the nucleus  to  regulate  transcription  [28].  It is  currently unclear why non-ER resident proteins such as the elongation factor EF1A-1 (eEF1A-1), Histone  H1b,  or  HSP7C  interact  with  GPx7  in  response  to  oxidative  stress. FOXC1  was  proved  to  be  a  transcription factor of GPX8 and mediated GPX8 expression to regulate cell development processes. [29] A study  found  that  GPX8  overexpression  increased  the  expression  of  wnt1,  wnt3a  and  β-catenin  and  decreased  the  expression  of  p-GSK3β,  thereby  activating  the  Wnt  signaling   pathway. [29]
Oxidized Trx is reduced by TrxR to maintain a pool of reduced Trx. Trx reduces peroxiredoxin (Prx), ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and methi-onine sulfoxide reductase (Msr). [30] These reductive enzymes catalyze the reduction of peroxides, ribonucleotides, and methionine sulfoxides, respectively. Trx also directly interacts with redox-sensitive molecules, such as apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1), thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Apart from reductive enzymes, Trx also interacts with redox-sensitive signaling molecules. [30] There are a number of transcription factors that are redox regulated and contain redox-sensitive cysteines in their DNA binding domain.[30] These Include activator protein 1 (AP-1), NF-jB, protein 21 (p21),protein 53 (p53), hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 al-pha (HIF-1), the glucocorticoid receptor, the estrogen recep-tor, PEBP2, EPF, Nrf2, Oct-4, and TFIIIC (172). [30] Txnip reacts with reduced Trx and forms an intermolecular disulfide cysteine 247.(B)No disulfide exchange reaction is possible between Txnip and oxidized Trx. [30]</p>

<li>Variants and their effect on PPI</li>
</ul>
<p>Polymorphisms in selenoproteins have been studied for over years. It is seen that the variant associated at different locations is an important study for many diseases. Epidemiological studies have implicated several selenoprotein genes in cancer risk or outcome based on associations between allelic variations and disease risk or mortality. In addition to GPX1 polymorphisms, other selenoprotein genes have also been linked to cancer risk when assessed in conjunction with selenium status. [31] Homozygous mutation in any component of the thioredoxin antioxidant system leading to inherited disease in humans.[32] Polymorphisms in the genes for two members of the thioredoxin reductase family of selenoproteins (TRXR1 and TRXR2) andSelenoprotein K (SELENOK) associated with prostate cancer risk only when selenium status was also considered, but they did not reside in the coding sequence or 3′-UTR, leaving the mechanism behind these associations subject to future studies.[31] The best known  polymorphism  of GPX1 is Pro198Leu, with the Leu allele being less responsive to enzyme activity during selenium supplementation.[33] Leu carriers for rs1050450 (Pro198Leu) in GPX1 have shown an increased risk of developing non-ductal breast cancer. However, this study of Pro198Leu polymorphism did not show susceptibility towards disease, but CAT which protects the cells against severe oxidative stress, also linked to GPX1 activity, led to the risk of increase in spontaneous abortion.[34]
A higher frequency of the Leu variant of rs1050450 (GPX1) was found in breast tumor DNA compared to normal tissue, probably due to loss of heterozygosity in the tumor cells. Risk was increased in individuals carrying both the Leu variant in GPX1 and the Ala variant. Since enzymatic assays have previously shown that the Leu protein variant is less active than the Pro counterpart,[34] proposed that high GPx1 activity is required to counterbalance the levels of ROS and related damage occurring during initiation or progression of the disease and hypothesize that the capacity of an individual to deliver Se to the breast tissue, generating high or low GPx1 activity determines the susceptibility of their breast tissue to oxidative damage and carcinogenesis. [34]
235 SNPs determined across the 6 genes, gave a result of 5  non-synonymous  variants, 6  synonymous  variants  and  224  non-coding  SNPs.  The  coding region  SNPs  identified  were  located  in  the  GPX1  (P75R,L91L, A192T and P198L), GPX3 (L13L), GPX4 (L193L),TXNRD1  (L55L,  L80L and C383C) and SEPP1  (K19E,A234T) (5). SNPs  of  potential  functional  importance include  the GPX1 P75R  and  P198L  variants,  a  high  frequency  GPX4 SECIS region SNP. There  is  strong  LD (Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the correlation between nearby variants such that the alleles at neighboring polymorphisms (observed on the same chromosome) are associated within a population more often than if they were unlinked.) between the GPX1 P198L, and nearby gene RHOA which is a ras onco-gene family gene, thus there is a possibility of the variant to be associated with cancer risk.[35] It has been found for the first time that the C718T polymorphism of the glutathione peroxidase-4 gene can be considered as a risk factor for cerebral stroke in hypertensive patients. The allele C718, the 718TC and 718CC genotypes of the GPX4 gene were found to be associated with it.[36] The OMIM database has another variant of GPX which causes Sedaghatian-type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. [37] The first variant, c.587+5G&gt;A, which was also identified in the mother, changes a highly conserved nucleotide, while the second, c.588-8_588-4del, is 5-bp deletion upstream of the 3’ splice acceptor site. [37]
The geno-micnucleotide sequence variations in theTXNRD3NT1 gene that may alter the concentration or activity of these proteins and ultimately contribute to the development of psoriasis. Part of this gene overlaps the  previously  described thioredoxin  reductase  3(TXNRD3)  gene,  we  have  named  it TXNRD3NT1(TXNRD3 new transcript). Two silent (SNPs) (A/G) were identified  within  the  5’-untranslated  region  (UTR) at the nucleotide positions 23 and 26.  One  polymorphic  site  (GGC/DEL)  was  found within  intron  4  at  nucleotide  position  36889.  These two SNP sites (T/C) in the 5’ promoter region were identified at nucleotide positions -203 and -196.[38] The studies gathered through these literature emphasize on exploring the variants, to understand how they affect the activity of the enzyme, investigating their role in functional changes and how they are associated with cancer.
SOD is involved in the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and it is represented in  three  forms:  SOD1,  which  is  located  in  the  cyto-plasm,  SOD2  (also  called  MnSOD  because  it  has  manganese  ion  in  its  catalytic  cleft),  which  exists  in  the mitochondria, and SOD3, which functions in the extracellular  matrix. [39] Of  these  isoforms,  SOD2  was  found  to  modify  cancer  susceptibility,  largely  due  to  several functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SOD2  gene. [39] The most well-studied  SNP in the SOD2  gene is SOD2 47T/C  (rs4880),  or  Val16Ala,  as it causes an amino acid substitution of valine (val) to alanine (val) on the 16th residue. [39] in 2003,  Hu and Diamond revealed a direct relationship between  the  presence  of  the  variant T allele of rs1050450 polymorphism and a dramatic decrease in the selenium-dependent activation of GPX1 enzyme in  breast  cancer  patients,  suggesting  its  role  in  sus-ceptibility  to  cancer  and  other  diseases. The rs4880 polymorphism of   SOD2  gene  and  the  rs1050450  polymorphism  of  GPX1 gene are the most commonly studied polymorphisms. [39] The T allele of the rs713041 polymorphism of  the  GPX4  gene  was  found  to  be  involved  in  colorectal  carcinogenesis. [39]</p>
