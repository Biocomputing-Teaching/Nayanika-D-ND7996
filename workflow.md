STRUCTURAL STUDY

1. Multiple sequence alignment of the isoforms of two proteins for checking the missing residues, catalytic residues, conserved sequence patterns

2. Exploring the modelled, unmodelled regions in the proteins with respect to the sequence, variant and structure in parallel

3. Identifying different Variants in the databases to check their location on the structure of proteins

4. Evaluating alterations in the active and catalytic site of the protein structures due to specific mutations

REACTION KINETICS

5. EVB (Empirical Valence Bond Simulations) on known mechanism

6. QM/MM calculations for mechanism not known completely

7. Checking for the residues involved in catalysis of the reaction in presence of mutants through free energy calculations

8. Phylogenetic analysis of different isoforms of GPX and TRXR

9. Homeostasis and redundancy of the biochemical networks due to presence of mutations in mammals and other organisms - To understand if mammalian mutations affect other organisms biological network as well

PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION

10. Identifying hotspot residues at PPI interfaces in GPX, TRXR

11. Evaluating the effect of mutations on PPI network present in the two proteins
