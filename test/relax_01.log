----------------------- Reading input from relax_01.inp ----------------------
Number of MD steps =     20000  Stepsize (fs)    =     0.050
 Not being verbose in temperature print out
Target temperature =      0.10  T-relax time     =    100.00
 No thermostat chosen. Berendsen thermostat will be used.
 Leap frog integrator used by default.
Solute and solvent atoms coupled separately to heat bath.
May redefine groups in later section
Generating seed from system time, please set seed manually to reproduce results
Initial velocities will be generated from Maxwell distribution:
Maxwell temperature=      0.10 Random number seed=       267
 Using Shake as the constraint algorithm
Shake constraints on solute bonds to any atoms : off
Nonbonded method   = LRF Taylor expansion outside cut-off
Using default temperature coupling groups
Boundary: sphere
